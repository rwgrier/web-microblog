			 <p>You may have noticed that I&rsquo;ve re-enabled a bit of a blogging feature here on the site. It&rsquo;s a micro blog. I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a> to host the (micro) blog.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used micro.blog in the past and enjoyed it. I also like supporting small independent developers. I&rsquo;m glad to be back.</p>
<p>I will not be bringing over any previous posts. You can get to those in the (archived) GitHub repo (<a href="https://github.com/rwgrier/blog.ryangrier.com">blog.ryangrier.com</a>). This is a clean slate.</p>
<p>The plan is to use this (micro) blog to post a mixture of short/long form posts.</p>
<p>When I had my previous blog going, I tried to focus on tech-related posts. That didn&rsquo;t work out for me. I would post infrequently. I eventually gave up. I hope that a mix of short/long posts I&rsquo;ll post a bit more.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see how this goes. Stay tuned?</p>
